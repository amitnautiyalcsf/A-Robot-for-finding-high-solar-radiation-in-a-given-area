# A-Robot-for-finding-high-solar-radiation-in-a-given-area
This project is based on two technologies working together to achieve a single goal which is feasible and can be used by existing companies, which are working on solar technology. The idea behind the project is that there is a moveable device with solar radiation tracker on its top, which will be moved in a given area and the point where there is maximum intensity of light will be found out. This point is the place where the solar panels could be installed because this will give maximum energy output due to presence of maximum light.
If this project could be applied at a large scale then solar industry will benefit a lot. They will save a lot of time and human resource used in installation of solar panels.
This project will be done on Arduino UNO microcontroller, connected to the car chassis and solar sensor. Programming will be done in embedded C. The main aim is to make the robot traverse the whole area in minimum time. 

Methodology

•	The main emphasis of the project is to make the robot traverse all the given area in minimum time possible.

•	For the achievement of this we first need to build an algorithm for it, rather than starting work on hardware.

•	The algorithm when created will be used to create a simulation in C program to see its working.

•	If the simulation works fine than all the hardware will be assembled to create the prototype.

•	All the code according to algorithm should be written for arduino in Arduino IDE.

•	The code is uploaded on the prototype and testing period is start.

•	If the prototype works fine then it is ready to released.
