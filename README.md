# A-Robot-for-finding-high-solar-radiation-in-a-given-area
Using Arduino UNO board and Embedded C as programming language, a robot is build which is capable of traversing a given area in minimum possible time. The robot provides solar radiation reading at all points of given area. Using this data it could be easily predicted which the highest radiation point is.
